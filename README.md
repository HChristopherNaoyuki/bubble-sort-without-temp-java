# Bubble Sort in Java

## Description
This Java program implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array in either ascending or descending order. The program prompts the user to enter an array and choose the sorting order. It also counts and displays the number of steps taken to sort the array.

## Features
- Accepts user input for the array size and elements.
- Allows sorting in ascending or descending order.
- Uses arithmetic operations for swapping without a temporary variable.
- Implements exception handling for invalid inputs.
- Optimized with an early exit condition if no swaps are needed.

## Example Output
```
Enter the number of elements:
5
Enter the elements:
3 1 4 1 5
Sort in ascending or descending order? (A/D):
a
Sorted array:
1 1 3 4 5
Steps taken: 10
```
